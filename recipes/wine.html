    <h3>Dinner with wine is fine</h3>
    <p>Although not a recipe, pairing wine is similar!  Just like an ingredient, wine will change the flavor of the entire meal all grouped together.  There's no bad choice in wine when it comes to a simple red or white.  It depends on your palette for dryness and depth.</p>
    <h3>To red or to white?  That is the question...</h3>
    <h4>Red wine characteristics</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Color: A dark ruby red wine can add a touch of elegance to even the most simplest of meals.</li>
        <li>Tannin:  This is the what gives the dryness feel and taste effect.  Similar to black tea or a bit of bitterness.</li>
        <li>Flavor and Aroma: The range is brilliant including fruit, floral, spice, and earth.</li>
        <li>Acid:  Acidity gives the tart and sour, which balances with the sweet and bitter.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>White wine characteristics</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Color:  The golden hues bring a crisp or cozy feel to your dinner experience.</li>
        <li>Tannin:  Similar to red wines, the dryness through tannins can vary widely.</li>
        <li>Flavor and Arom:  Again the range is enormous though with a tendency for lighter flavors and undertones as compared to the reds.</li>
        <li>Acid:  Whites will tend to have more tart and sour, but keep in mind they can also be incredibly sweet.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Choosing the right wine</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The wine should be more acidic than the food.</li>
        <li>The wine should be sweeter than the food</li>
        <li>The wine should have the same flavor intensity as the food</li>
        <li>Red wines pair best with bold meals.</li>
        <li>White wines pair best with light meals.</li>
        <li>Bitter wines are balanced with fatty meals.</li>
        <li>White wines tend to create contrasting pairings.</li>
        <li>Red wines tend to create congruent pairings</li>
    </ol>
